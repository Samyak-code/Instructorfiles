# MIT RACECAR-MN Lecture Slides

This directory contains the PowerPoint source files for the slides used in the RACECAR-MN curriculum. These are included for instructors who wish to modify the provided lecture slides for their course.

The `code` directory contains code snippets used in the lecture slides. Most of these code snippets are not intended to be run.

The `extra` directory contains a few extra slide decks which are not part of the main lecture series. `RacecarPuzzles.pptx` contains several puzzles which challenge students' problem solving abilities while introducing computational topics such as bit operations and data structures. They work especially well as team-building activities.

The `pdf` directory contains PDF exports of each presentation. These files can also be found on the main website.
